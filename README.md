### How do I approach designing software?

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**  
Working on this 3D graphics project has refined my ability to think about **modular design**. I learned to separate concerns such as rendering, user input, scene management, and shading code. This approach ensures that each piece is testable and easier to maintain.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**  
I began by **identifying functional requirements** (such as lighting, texturing, and transformations) and **conceptualizing a high-level architecture**, including class responsibilities (ShaderManager, SceneManager, etc.). I then iterated on details, implementing one feature at a time—like setting up directional lighting—before moving on to more complex additions, such as point or spotlights.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**  
Breaking down tasks into **manageable increments** and using an **iterative approach** can be applied to almost any software project. By tackling smaller pieces, regularly testing them, and then integrating them into the larger system, you can continuously refine your design. This reduces errors and makes it easier to adapt to changing requirements.

### How do I approach developing programs?

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**  
I practiced an **incremental development strategy** more rigorously than before. Each time I added a new aspect (like a spotlight or a new texture), I compiled and tested in small steps. This helped me quickly isolate bugs and remain confident that working code stayed working.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**  
Iteration was crucial. I started with a **basic scene** (one shape, one simple light), tested it, and then added more complexity (texture mapping, multiple lights, etc.). Regularly testing each iteration meant I could detect and fix errors without getting overwhelmed by simultaneous, unrelated problems.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**  
Initially, I focused on just making the scene render something. Over time, I embraced **best practices** like consistent commenting, modularizing classes (so each class has a clear responsibility), and writing more reusable methods for transformations and lighting setup. By the end, my workflow felt smoother because I’d established a pattern for making changes, testing them, and moving forward systematically.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**  
Studying 3D graphics deepened my understanding of **mathematics** (linear algebra, transformations) and **real-time rendering** concepts. These are transferable skills for advanced coursework in computer science, game development, simulation, and machine learning visualization.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**  
Mastering these graphical concepts opens doors to roles in **game development, AR/VR, product design**, and **data visualization**. Whether I’m building interactive 3D applications or creating immersive simulations, this project has equipped me with a solid grounding in modern graphics pipelines, shader programming, and performance considerations—skills that are valuable in many technical and creative industries.
